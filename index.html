<H1>Hello World</H1>
<p>Honestly, I took this class because I really didn't have anything else to fill my schedule. I didn't even know that it was an option, but since I found out that I got in, I love it. I want to learn more about programing so I can make my own website in the future, and maybe even learn how to make an app.</p>
